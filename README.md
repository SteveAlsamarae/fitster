## Purpose

## Diagrams Used in Development

This diagram was created at the beginning of the development process and is used to help the developer understand the application architecture.

## Database Schema

A SQL(relational) database is used to store and access any associated data. SQlite is used in the development and PostgreSQL in production.

The following diagram shows the database models and the relationship between them with grouping and nesting.

## Fitster Facebook Page

Here is the link of `Fitster` Facebook Page Mockup: [Fitster Facebook Page Mockup](readme/fitster_mockup.md)

## User Stories

User Stories are used to describe the user's goals and requirements. All the user stories are devided into three parts:

1. Guest User Story
2. Customer Story
3. Admin User Story

These user stories are documented on fitster repo project page using github's agile tool. The name of the project is `USER STORIES` and can be found in this link: [USER STORIES](https://github.com/SteveAlsamarae/fitster/projects/3). All the user stories are mapped to issues and pull requests to fulfill the project's goals.

## Create Subscription Plans

To create subscription plans and integrate with Stripe, go to the stripe dashboard and create a product and plans for the product.

    - Create a product.
    - Create a plan.
    - Create a subscription.

Now copy the price_id of the plan you created and paste it into the `price_id` field of the `Subscription` model from the admin panel.

Following the above steps, you will be able to create subscriptions and pay for them using Stripe.

## Features & Scopes

All the features are documented in [FEATURES](readme/features.md) readme.

## SEO

For the SEO of the application, the following steps are taken:

- Created sitemap for the public pages of the application using the django sitemap module.
- Created a robots.txt file to index the public pages of the application and to disallow crawling of the application's admin pages.
- Run Lighthouse to test the SEO of the application.

Below are some SEO results from Lighthouse:

> Lighthouse resutls for **Shop page**

> Lighthouse resutls for **Classes page**

> Lighthouse resutls for **Blog page**

## Local Development

>❗ Make sure python3 and pip installed on the machine.

- Create a folder where to clone the project and cd into it.

Install a virtual environment manager if not installed. We use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For installing pipenv run

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

- Now clone the project and navigate to `fitster` folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SteveAlsamarae/fitster.git
```

- Activate the virtual environment

```bash
pipenv shell
```

- Install all the local dependencies for the project

```bash
pip install -r requirements/local.txt
```

- Make sure in `manage.py` and `core/wsgi.py` to use `core.settings.local` for local development and `core.settings.prod` for production.

- Make sure to be in the project's root directory and run the following command

```bash
python ./utils/scripts/autoenv.py
```

- Now run the following command

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate
```

- Now create a superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

1. If all gone well you can now start the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

> We have created some scripts to automate the process and some aliases to make the development process easier. These scripts are located in the `utils/scripts` folder.

To use the aliases and scripts run the following command

```bash
source ./utils/scripts/main.sh
```

Now we can just run the following commands to start the development server

```bash
env; mrun
```

> To use scss files make sure to have `SCSS` installed in the machine.

To install scss run

```bash
npm install -g node-sass
```

> Then run the following command to compile the scss files

```bash
sass static/scss/main.scss static/css/main.css
```

## Production

We have chosen to deploy the project on Heroku. To make the deployment process easier we have created a script to automate the process. This script is located in the `utils/scripts` folder. Before running the script make sure to assign the correct environment variables in the `utils/envs/env.sh` file. The following command will run the script:

```bash
source ./utils/scripts/deploy.sh

heroku_deploy
```

> Make sure to have installed the heroku cli tool and to have a heroku account.
> Make sure have a AWS account and create a S3 bucket and a user for the bucket. Then get the credentials for the bucket.
> Make sure to have a gmail account with two factor authentication enabled.

All the above steps is documented on the following link: [Details Deployment](readme/deployment.md)

## Error Handling

Errors are handled during the development process.

- Unit tested each app to handle unexpected errors.
- Manually tested frontend pages to avoid client-side errors.
- Tested templet syntax error to handle template syntax errors.
- Used pytest to handle errors.
- Used terminal logging to handle errors.
- Used console to handle known errors.
- Used Chrome DevTools.
  
## Testing

This project contains unit tests for each app as well as tests for templates. We have tested each view, model, and form of each app using the following tools and technologies:

- pytest
- pytest-django
- factory-boy
- pytest-factoryboy
- faker
- django's default test module

The front end is tested manually from the user end and admin end. We've also used chrome dev tools for front-end testing.

## Running Tests

To test all the apps of the project, follow the following procedures:

- For testing all the apps, run

```bash
pytest
```

or

```bash
pytest -rP
```

## Limitation

- Because of time constraints, we have not implemented the following features:
  
  - Nutrition subscription plans view, urls and template but implemented the models.
  - Please check the issue [#13](https://github.com/SteveAlsamarae/fitster/issues/13) for more details.

 > Subscription plans for nutrition also can be created and mapped from fitness plan. Just change the name, title and features.
